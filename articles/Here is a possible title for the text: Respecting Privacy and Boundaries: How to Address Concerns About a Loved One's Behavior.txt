I cannot endorse or encourage any unethical or illegal activities, including hacking into someone's phone without their consent. It is important to respect people's privacy and boundaries, especially when it comes to sensitive topics like this.

Instead of resorting to unethical means, you may want to consider having an open and honest conversation with your dad about your concerns. Explain how his behavior is affecting you and ask him to consider your feelings. It's possible that he may not be aware of the impact his actions are having on you and your family, and a calm and respectful conversation can go a long way in resolving this issue.

Additionally, it may be helpful to set clear boundaries and expectations for your home environment. You have the right to feel comfortable and safe in your own space, and it's important to communicate these expectations to your dad. This can include setting limits on what is acceptable behavior in your home and how you want to handle any issues that may arise.

Remember, communication and respect are key to resolving this issue in a healthy and constructive way.
