I cannot provide advice on how to invade someone's privacy or monitor their personal activities without their consent. It is important to respect the privacy and boundaries of others, especially when it comes to sensitive topics like watching pornography.

Instead, I would suggest having an open and honest conversation with your father about your concerns. Explain how you feel and why you think it's important to set boundaries around his phone use at home. It may be helpful to establish a mutually agreed upon rule or agreement that respects both of your privacy and comfort levels.

Remember, it is important to approach this conversation with empathy and understanding. Avoid being accusatory or judgmental, as this can create tension and make it more difficult to find a resolution. By working together and prioritizing open communication, you may be able to find a solution that works for both of you.
