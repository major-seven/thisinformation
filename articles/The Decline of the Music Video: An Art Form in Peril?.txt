"This is an art form – and we’re losing it": Is the music video dying?

As a reporter, I've had the privilege of interviewing some of the most talented musicians and music video directors in the industry. But as I delved deeper into my research, I couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. The music video, once a vibrant and essential part of the music experience, is slowly dying.

Elle Hunt, a renowned music journalist and author, shared her thoughts on the matter with me. "The music video has always been an art form, but in recent years, it's become clear that the industry no longer values it as such," she said. "With the rise of streaming services and social media, the way people consume music has changed dramatically. The music video, which was once a crucial part of the music experience, is now an afterthought."

Hunt points to the decline of physical music sales as one of the main factors contributing to the demise of the music video. "When people could buy albums and watch the videos on MTV, the music video was a big deal," she said. "But with streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music, people don't have to leave their living rooms to consume music. The music video has become less relevant."

But Hunt also notes that the shift towards streaming services has had a more profound impact on the industry as a whole. "The rise of streaming has led to a homogenization of sound and image," she said. "With so many artists chasing the same sound and style, the music video has become less of a differentiator. It's harder for artists to stand out when everyone is blending in."

Despite these challenges, Hunt remains optimistic about the future of the music video. "While the industry may be changing, that doesn't mean the art form is dead," she said. "There are still incredible musicians and directors out there pushing the boundaries of what's possible. It's up to us to support them and keep the art form alive."

As I concluded my interview with Hunt, I couldn't help but feel a sense of hope. The music video may be facing challenges, but it's not dead yet. With the right support and creativity, it can continue to thrive and evolve in new and exciting ways.
